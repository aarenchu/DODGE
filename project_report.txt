Project Plan
--------


Project Title: DODGE




Provide a one paragraph description of your project:
The program is a game where the player, represented by a square of one colour, has to dodge enemies, represented by squares of a distinctly different colour. The player’s score is gauged by how long the player has successfully avoided colliding with an enemy within a certain timeframe. If the player does collide with an enemy, their score is reset to 0. However, the score will continue increasing until the time is up. The player sprite is controlled by the arrow keys. The score and timer are displayed on the HEX displays.


What is your plan for the first week?
To implement:
* The main display screen
* The structure of the player circle object (i.e. color, position on screen etc.)
* The movement behavior of the player circle (i.e. changing position on screen in 4 directions)
* The control mechanism (i.e. mapping the keyboard arrow keys to the movement behavior)


What is your plan for the second week?
To implement:
* The structure of the enemy circle objects (i.e. color, position on screen etc.)
* The movement behavior of the enemy circles (i.e. changing position on screen randomly)
* The detection of collision between enemy circles and player circle(i.e. calculating the distance between the two different circles and resetting the score to only if a collision has occurred)
* The functionality of timer and score


What is your plan for the third week?
* Continually testing the program to cover all edge cases and everything in between
* Getting ready for presentation of the finalized version of the game


What is your backup plan if things don't work out as planned?
* Keeping the general features that already work as a basis while simplifying some of the game mechanisms (e.g. having one enemy object instead of multiple)
* Removing the score and timer and instead the HEX displays only display a certain number of lives that when the number is 0 then the game will be over.

Weekly Reports
--------------
<In this space, provide a report each week of what worked and what didn't, and what (if any) changes were made to your proposal)>

Week 1:
    We came up with an outline for the various elements of the project and reviewed other projects to see if they have any matching features we can use to expand on them. Also, we debugged the display from lab 6 to incorporate the draw mechanism of our game into the code that we already have. We are still working on putting together the features of the player object.
