# DODGE
The program is a game where the player, represented by a circle of one colour, has to dodge enemies, represented by circles of a distinctly different colour. The playerâ€™s score is gauged by how long the player has successfully avoided colliding with an enemy within a certain timeframe. If the player does collide with an enemy, their score is reset to 0. However, the score will continue increasing until the time is up. The player sprite is controlled by the KEYS. The score and timer are displayed on the HEX displays.
